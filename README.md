# Wordie

This is my iOS version of the game Wordle, tailored so the user can include a custom list of legal guess words and goal words.
It's made using Swift, and the required word lists are plain text documents.

Anyone with the same version of Wordie on their phone will get the same word for each day, just like Wordle. There are also options to share your score once you've solved the puzzle.
